ABM using Netlogo

In this study, we investigated how well the agents with conservative or open-mindedness behaviours compete with each other for food in a simulated environment using NetLogo (Wilensky, 1999), agent-based modelling. 

In our model that is based on Čače and Bryson’s model (2007), two types of agents ”Believer” and ”Doubter” aim to survive and reproduce in a confined virtual environment.
