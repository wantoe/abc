# agent-based-modelling
ABM using Netlogo

In this study, we investigated how well the 2 agents with conservative or open-mindedness behaviours compete with each other for food in a simulated environment using NetLogo (Wilensky, 1999), agent-based modelling. 

In our model that is based on Čače and Bryson’s model (2007), two types of agents ”Believer” and ”Doubter” aim to survive and reproduce in a confined virtual environment.

All the information on on the method and the analysis can be found in document "CW4 for submission.docx"
The assignment requirement and instructions can be found in ICCS_CW2_2020.pdf

#How to use? 
1) Download Netlogo software
2) open the source code "ICCS CW4 By whet20  believer_and_doubter FINAL.nlogo", using Netlogo. Click setup, then click go.

# What I learnt
- desiging and setting up Agent Based Modelling experiements.
- analysing data from Agent Based Modelling to validate a hypothesis.
